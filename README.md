ChordScript starts as a thesis project for [a computer engineering student](https://antiloope.github.io/rodri-page/) with a lot of enthusiasm and dedication.

This project is based on three personal motivations: **Learning, Music and Programming**. If you combine this ingredients and add a lot of time and dedication, ChordScript spawns.

Obviously this project is similar to many other existing projects as [Sonic-Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome), and many others

In this repo, there is the source code for [ChordScript](). The interpreter of the language and an IDE.

Built using [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/) and [Jack Audio](https://jackaudio.org/). Developed in [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/).
